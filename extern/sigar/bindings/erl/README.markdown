## SIGAR driver for Erlang

If you're not already familar with sigar, have a look at the [SIGAR Wiki](http://sigar.hyperic.com).

Also helpful: **../../include/sigar.h**, **../*/examples** and
**../java/src/org/hyperic/sigar/cmd/** to get an idea of what you can do.

### Building

The other bindings/* inline the libsigar sources by default, haven't done that yet for erl.
So, you'll need a libsigar to link against, one of:

Ant build:

        cd ../java ; ant
        ln -s sigar-bin/lib/libsigar-amd64-linux.so sigar-lib/lib/libsigar.so

Or, download release binary created by the ant build:

        curl -o priv/libsigar.so http://svn.hyperic.org/projects/sigar_bin/dist/SIGAR_1_6_2/lib/libsigar-amd64-linux.so

Or, top-level autotools build (WIP):

        cd ../.. ; ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make install

Once you have a libsigar in place, just run **make** and have a look at the **examples/**.

Note that the majority of the driver code is generated by **../SigarWrapper.pm** and output to **priv/gen**.

### ToDo/Help Wanted

* Fill out the **examples/** - currently weaksauce in part due to me having just a few hours w/ Erlang

* Build system - doubt the current will work anywhere cept Linux

* EUnit

* Other stuff Erlangers know that I don't
